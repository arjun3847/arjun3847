ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Arjun Khatri, an aspiring Software Engineer currently interning at H&R Block.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing a stock trading simulator to combine my development skills with financial interests to gain valuable insights into financial market dynamics, trading strategies and investment principles. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m focused on honing my skills in backend development tools to better complement my frontend development skills, with the goal of becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on Software Engineering projects. I thrive in diverse team environments where we can explore new technologies and solve complex problems together.
